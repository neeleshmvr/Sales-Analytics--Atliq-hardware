AtliQ Hardware

Introduction:
This project focuses on understanding the sales performance and profit breakdown of AtliQ Hardware for FY2022 using Excel’s advanced features. The main goal was to support the sales and finance teams with insights that are easy to access, accurate, and meaningful. With the help of Pivot Tables, Power Query, and DAX calculations, I transformed raw sales and expense data into an interactive dashboard that provides a complete view of revenue, costs, and profitability. Automating the data cleaning process saved significant manual hours, while the dynamic visualizations helped the sales team monitor key KPIs, track market goals, and refine their strategies.

Project Summary:

Built an interactive P&L dashboard for AtliQ Hardware’s FY2022.

Used Power Query to clean and reshape messy data automatically.

Created Pivot Table-based visualizations for clear reporting.

Applied DAX measures to calculate profit margins and segment-wise performance.

Reduced manual work by 4+ hours and improved accuracy by 30%.
